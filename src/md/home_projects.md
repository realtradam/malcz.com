**Pure Ruby Engine Agnostic ECS Framework** — May 2021 - Feb 2022

- Developed a complete engine agnostic game development framework in pure Ruby allowing it to be used with any Ruby based game engine(Ruby2D, Gosu, DragonRuby).
- Achieved complete test coverage, ensuring that the code will work as expected and desired.
- Created comprehensive and detailed documentation explaining how to use every single feature in a well organized and easy to read document.

## [Orc: Arena of Time](https://malcz.com/game/orc-arena-of-time)
**Gamejam Web Game** — Jan 2022

- Won 1st place in an 8 day game jam and competed against 41 entries.
- Embedded mruby, the portable Ruby interpreter, into the game by developing C bindings with the Raylib rendering library thus allowing Ruby to be compiled and run on the web. This enabled faster iteration on the game thus resulting in more features and polish in the final product.
- Collaborated with a team member to contribute code and ideas to the project faster and more reliably then otherwise possible by working alone.
