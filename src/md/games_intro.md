Here are a collection of games I have either made myself or in collaboration with others. These games have all been made for a variety of platforms(Web, Desktop, N64) using a variety of technologies(Raylib, BGFX, a Self-Made Engine, Unity, Godot) using a variety of languages(C, Ruby, C#, GDScript) but they all share one thing in common: they are **fun to play** and **they all run right in your web browser!** Try them out!
