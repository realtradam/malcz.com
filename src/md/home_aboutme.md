# This is My Corner of the Web

I am both a professional and hobbyist developer. In a professional setting I am able to adapt and utilize any tech stack required of me and I have successfully done so. Meanwhile in a hobbyist setting I tend to stick to Ruby and C as well as a bit of the common web stack technologies like JavaScript and HTML/CSS. However I do also enjoy venturing into new forays, exploring and learning new areas of technology.

I hope you enjoy your stay here and don't forget to check out my playable games I have created!
