# [Game Holster](https://github.com/realtradam/gameHolster)

Game holster is a web game hosting site where you can upload and play games like the good old days of flash game websites in the mid 2000s!

The backend has the MVP complete which includes uploading and serving games, as well as having accounts which can be created by logging in through GitHub OAuth.

The frontend is currently a work in progress. It is shared right now with this portfolio website. This means that to upload a game you would need to log in using the top left GitHub login, however it is currently set up to only allow myself to upload for the time being as I continue development. All the games shown here on this website were uploaded to and are being served through the Game Holster API, showing that it works as a proof of concept. It is able to serve web games exported from major game engines such as Unity and Godot as well as Raylib and a custom game engine I have made myself.
